# API Protection Implementation Details

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of API key protection in the AIMBTI iOS app. The app exclusively uses a proxy server to protect API keys, ensuring they are never exposed in the client application.

## Implementation Status
âœ… **Completed**: API protection has been successfully implemented with proxy-only mode.

## Architecture

### 1. APIKeyManager (Core Component)
Location: `/AIMBTI/Services/APIKeyManager.swift`

**Key Features:**
- Singleton pattern for centralized API management
- Always returns proxy endpoint for API calls
- No API keys stored or transmitted from the client
- Simple, secure implementation

**Security Features:**
- All builds use proxy mode exclusively
- API keys are never present in the app
- No environment variable access
- Complete separation of client and API authentication

### 2. Proxy Server Configuration
The app connects to a Vercel-hosted proxy server that handles all OpenAI API communications.

**Proxy Endpoint:**
- Base URL: `https://aimbti-api-proxy.vercel.app`
- OpenAI endpoint: `https://aimbti-api-proxy.vercel.app/api/openai`

### 3. Integration Points

#### ChatService Integration
- Uses APIKeyManager for endpoint configuration
- Sends requests to proxy without authentication headers
- Proxy server adds OpenAI API key server-side

#### Debug Tools
- API Debug View for testing proxy connectivity
- Visual confirmation of proxy-only mode
- Connection testing capabilities

## Security Benefits

1. **Zero Client-Side API Keys**: The iOS app contains no API keys
2. **Server-Side Authentication**: All API authentication happens on the proxy server
3. **No Configuration Needed**: Users don't need to manage API keys
4. **Simplified Codebase**: Removed complexity of dual-mode operation

## Deployment Notes

- Ensure Vercel proxy server is deployed with OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
- Proxy server handles all authentication and request forwarding
- iOS app requires no special configuration for API access
